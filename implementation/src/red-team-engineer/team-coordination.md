# Red Team Coordination & Rules of Engagement

This document defines the operational protocols, communication triggers, and handoff procedures for the Red Team Operator within the TechNova project.

## 1. Operational Phases & Triggers

The Red Team activities are strictly bound to specific project phases. Operations outside these windows are unauthorized.

| Phase | Trigger Event | Red Team Action | Handoff To |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 0** | Infrastructure Ready | **Connectivity Check:** Verify SSH to Linux & RDP to Windows. Confirm Caldera agent connectivity. | Blue Team (for Monitoring Setup) |
| **Phase 1** | Blue Team "Ready" Signal | **Execute Baseline Attack:** Run `Project_Story_Mode`. Generate noise (port scans) and artifacts. | Threat Analyst (for Detection) |
| **Phase 2** | N/A | **Standby:** Assist Analyst with timestamps and attack logic explanation if detection fails. | Blue Team (for Hardening) |
| **Phase 3** | Blue Team "Hardened" Signal | **Execute Re-run:** Attempt same attacks against new defenses. Document failures. | Project Lead (Final Report) |

## 2. Communication Protocol

To ensure accurate logging by the Threat Analyst, the Red Team will broadcast the following signals via the team channel:

### START SIGNAL
> "🚨 **RED TEAM OP STARTING:** Operation `[Op_Name]` initiated against targets `10.10.0.50` and `10.10.0.51`. Timestamp: `[HH:MM]`."

### STOP SIGNAL
> "🛑 **RED TEAM OP FINISHED:** All objectives executed. Artifacts created: `Exfil_Proof.txt`, `psexec` service. Please preserve logs."

### BLOCKER REPORT (Infrastructure Issues)
> "⚠️ **OP PAUSED:** Technical blocker detected (e.g., Auth Failure). Ticket assigned to Infrastructure Engineer."

## 3. Interaction with Other Roles

### Interface with Infrastructure Engineer
*   **Request:** Credentials, IP allocation, specific software pre-installation (e.g., python3 on Linux).
*   **Provide:** Feedback on network visibility and access controls.

### Interface with Blue Team Engineer
*   **Adversary Emulation:** Provide the specific TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used so they can tune their WAF/IDS rules.
*   **Debrief:** Explain how specific blocks (e.g., Defender) affected the attack chain.

### Interface with Threat Analyst
*   **Time Synchronization:** Ensure Caldera server time matches SIEM time.
*   **Ground Truth:** Provide the "Execution Log" to validate whether the SIEM actually detected the attack or if it was a false negative.

## 4. Tools & Artifacts Handoff

The technical evidence generated by CALDERA operations is stored in the project's **`results/`** directory for cross-team analysis.

**Location of Artifacts:**
*   **Path:** `results/red_team/phase1-baseline/`
*   **Contents uploaded:**
    *   `debrief_*.pdf` (Executive summary of the attack via Debrief plugin)
    *   `debrief_*.json` (Raw attack data export)
    *   `layer.json` (MITRE ATT&CK Navigator layer file)
    *   `Project_Demo_Run_report.json` (Detailed operation logs)

**Note:** Physical files are synchronized to the repository relative to the project root.
